// cin >> - use when user is inputting information
//cout << - use when machine is giving info to user 
// the arrows matter. end lines with semi colons
// the \n (called escape sequences) ends the line and prints the next line on a new line. goes inside the "". it is not necessary 
// \t is tab, gives space on same line, not differet line 
// <<std:endl also ends line. good for variables 
// /* .... */ for long paragraph comments, like this one
